<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Vaishnavi ðŸ‘‹</h1>

#### A little bit about myself

- I am a proactive individual with a keen interest in cutting-edge technology and a strong commitment to continuous learning. Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Financial Mathematics at NC State University, with the ultimate goal of establishing a career as a Quantitative Modeller within the Investment banking sector. I have consistently demonstrated my proficiency in mathematics, finance, analytics, and programming courses, maintaining a commendable GPA of 4.0. Additionally, I have actively engaged in industry-specific projects that have honed my problem-solving skills in the realm of mathematics and finance.

- For Summer 2023, I am interning at U.S. Bancorp as Quantitative Model Analyst in the Daily Cash Flow Analysis/Operational Risk-Corporate Treasury division. I am currently developing comprehensive models for wholesale deposit forecasting, enhancing accuracy through statistical techniques. Additionally I am involved in operational risk estimation, leveraging machine learning algorithms to drive strategic planning.

- Before relocating to the United States, I was a Quantitative Risk Analyst at Morgan Stanley Advantage Services Pvt Ltd. I excelled in developing market risk and credit risk projection models. I successfully optimised Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) methodologies and effectively addressed regulatory concerns, demonstrating my ability to meet rigorous risk management requirements. My experience also encompassed parameter recalibration and the submission of IRC IMA applications to regulators, showcasing my expertise in navigating complex regulatory frameworks while ensuring compliance.

- Prior to my current academic pursuit, I successfully completed my undergraduate studies, earning an M.Sc. (Hons.) in Economics and a B.E. (Hons.) in Civil Engineering from BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. During this period, I seized the opportunity to intern at Nomura in Rates structuring team under Global Markets Division , where I gained firsthand exposure to the financial industry and the practical application of my academic knowledge. Later My approach to problem-solving, characterized by lateral thinking and innovation, received commendation from the institution, leading to my subsequent appointment as a Quantitative Risk Analyst.

- I am seeking a full-time opportunity that will not only allow me to grow in a professional capacity and increase my knowledge base, but more importantly also allow me to contribute to an area that is constantly evolving, deeply interesting, and extremely cutting-edge.

1. I am currently working on Sentiment Analysis for Event-Driven Stock Prediction. This project leverages deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict accurate stock price movements based on news headlines, showcasing proficiency in NLP. It involved data engineering skills by using innovative web scraping and data preprocessing techniques to gather, preprocess, and analyze vast amounts of news data, preparing it for use in highly accurate CNN models. To know more about CNNs please go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) 

2. I am currently learning C++, Java for Quantitative Finance.
